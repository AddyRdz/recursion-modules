# Recursion

Throughout this course, we will use a combination of myGA modules assigned as homework as well as in-class exercises to learn the fundamentals of computer science topics. 

For the myGA modules, focus on grasping the main ideas and larger concepts. The following morning, we will practice applying these ideas to code! 

## Instructions

1. Follow along the steps in this README to progress through the myGA modules.
1. When you are finished, submit your assignment by clicking on the "Issues" tab above this repo to start a new issue.
1. The issue template will ask that you answer a number of exit ticket questions before submitting your issue, to summarize your learning on this topic.

Tomorrow morning, we will dive deeper into understanding and writing recursive functions.

>Note: The myGA module links to a coding exercise on CodePen. 

For tonight, focus on understanding recursion conceptually. Do try out the provided coding exercises, as they will help you with your understanding. However you are not required to complete them as part of this deliverable.

## Overview

There are two parts to this lesson. For your deliverable you will be reading through the myGA modules and answering the questions in the "Issues" template.
1. [myGA module: Recursion](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/773)
2. [In-class Lesson: Writing Recursive Functions](exercises/recursion.js) - Tomorrow's activity!

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Define recursion.
- Write the base case and recursive cases of a recursive function.
- Identify functions that use recursion and explain why itâ€™s used.

## Prerequisites

- Big O Notation
